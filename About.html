      <strong>Eid Mubarak</strong><br />
      Eid Mubarak or (Arabic: عيد مبارك) is an Arabic term that means “Blessed
      feast/festival'”. The term is used by Arab Muslims, as well as Muslims all
      over the world. Internationally Muslims use it as a greeting for use on
      the feast. In the social sense, people usually celebrate Eid al-Fitr after
      Ramadan and Eid al-Adha in the month of Dhul Hijjah (the 12th and final
      Islamic month). Some state that this exchange of greetings is a cultural
      tradition and not part of any religious obligation.

      <strong>Regional Variations</strong><br />
      Throughout the Muslim world there are numerous other greetings for Eid
      ul-Adha and Eid ul-Fitr. The companions of the Prophet Mohammad used to
      say to each other in Arabic when they met on Eid ul-Fitr: Taqabbalallâhu
      minnâ wa minkum (which means "[May] God accept from us and you [our fasts
      and deeds]"). Throughout the Muslim world, variations in Eid greetings
      exist.

      <strong>Eid in Pakistan</strong><br />
      Pakistan Urdu speakers, traditionally, only start saying the greeting
      after the Eid prayer. However, newer generations typically resort to
      saying the greeting at midnight of the Eid day, similar to other special
      days such as New Year's Day or birthdays. They use the greeting "Eid
      Mubarak" (Urdu: عید مبارک) which is traditionally replied with "Khair
      Mubarak" (Urdu: خیر مبارک). "Āp ko bhi Eid Mubarak" (Urdu: آپ کو بھی عید
      مبارک, lit. 'Eid Mubarak to you as well') is a rising alternative response
      among the newer urban generations. Pashto speakers (mainly Pashtun people
      from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Afghanistan) also use the Eid
      greeting "May your festival be blessed" (Pashto: اختر دې مبارک شه ; akhtar
      de mubarak sha). Balochi speakers (mainly Baloch people from Balochistan
      province and Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan Province) also use the Eid
      greeting "May your Eid be blessed" (عید تر مبارک با ; aied tara mubarak
      ba). Brahui speakers may also use the Eid greeting "Have a blessed Eid"
      (عید نے مبارک مارے ; aied ne mubarak mare).

      <strong>Eid in Canada</strong><br />
      Eid al-Fitr is an important Islamic holiday for the Muslim community in
      Canada. This event involves many Muslims waking up early and praying
      either at an outdoor prayer ground or a mosque. People dress in their
      finest clothes and adorn their homes with lights and other decorations.
      Old wrongs are forgiven and money is given to the poor. Special foods are
      prepared and friends or relatives are invited to share the feast. Gifts
      and greeting cards are exchanged and children receive presents. Eid
      al-Fitr is a joyous occasion but its underlying purpose is to praise God
      and give thanks to him, according to Islamic belief. Large crowds have
      gathered to celebrate Eid al-Fitr in cities such as Ottawa in the recent
      past. Political leaders in Canada have also made statements to wish their
      best to Islamic communities during the Eid al-Fitr celebrations.
      Children’s publications about holidays such as Eid al-Fitr have also
      written and made available in many parts of North America, including
      Canada.
